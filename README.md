# Yet Another Twitter Link Expander

## Rationale

YATLE is a port of Tiny Twitter Link Expander
(https://github.com/hoodunit/tiny-twitter-link-expander)
to WebExtensions.

It replaces shortened t.co links on twitter.com, which track your clicks
and how you share them, with the original links that have no such data
attached.

Note that this only activates on twitter.com itself.
